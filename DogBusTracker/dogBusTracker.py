# üêæ Dog Bus Tracker ‚Äî Challenge Steps
#
# 1. Start with a bus dictionary holding current passengers.
#    - Each seat number (1, 2, 3, ...) is a key
#    - Each value is another dictionary with each pet's:
#        ‚Ä¢ name
#        ‚Ä¢ breed
#        ‚Ä¢ pickup time
#        ‚Ä¢ dropoff time

    3: {"name": "Charlie", "breed": "Beagle", "pickupTime": "9:30 AM", "dropoffTime": "5:15 PM"},
    4: {"name": "Luna", "breed": "Husky", "pickupTime": "9:45 AM", "dropoffTime": "5:30 PM"}
}

#
# 2. Print a starting roster showing each pet's seat, name, and pickup time.

# 3. Add one new pet if there's room on the bus.
#    - Use MAX_SEATS to limit capacity.
#    - Dynamically assign the next seat number.
#    - Print the updated roster showing all pets after pickup.
