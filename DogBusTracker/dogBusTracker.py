# üêæ Dog Bus Tracker ‚Äî Challenge Steps
#
# 1. Start with a bus dictionary holding current passengers.
#    - Each seat number (1, 2, 3, ...) is a key
#    - Each value is another dictionary with each pet's:
#        ‚Ä¢ name
#        ‚Ä¢ breed
#        ‚Ä¢ pickup time
#        ‚Ä¢ dropoff time

    1: {"name": "Max", "breed": "Labrador", "pickupTime": "9:00 AM", "dropoffTime": "5:00 PM"},
    2: {"name": "Bella", "breed": "Poodle", "pickupTime": "9:15 AM", "dropoffTime": "4:30 PM"},
    3: {"name": "Charlie", "breed": "Beagle", "pickupTime": "9:30 AM", "dropoffTime": "5:15 PM"},
    4: {"name": "Luna", "breed": "Husky", "pickupTime": "9:45 AM", "dropoffTime": "5:30 PM"}
}

#
# 2. Print a starting roster showing each pet's seat, name, and pickup time.
print("Starting Roster:")

# 3. Add one new pet if there's room on the bus.
#    - Use MAX_SEATS to limit capacity.
#    - Dynamically assign the next seat number.
#    - Print the updated roster showing all pets after pickup.

#    - Remove that pet from the bus.
#    - Print a message saying they've headed home.
