# üêæ Dog Bus Tracker ‚Äî Challenge Steps
#
# 1. Start with a bus dictionary holding current passengers.
#    - Each seat number (1, 2, 3, ...) is a key
#    - Each value is another dictionary with each pet's:
#        ‚Ä¢ name
#        ‚Ä¢ breed
#        ‚Ä¢ pickup time
#        ‚Ä¢ dropoff time

    4: {"name": "", "breed": "", "pickupTime": "", "dropoffTime": ""}
}

#
# 2. Print a starting roster showing each pet‚Äôs seat, name, and pickup time.

# 3. Add one new pet if there‚Äôs room on the bus.  
#    - Use MAX_SEATS to limit capacity.  
#    - Dynamically assign the next seat number.  
#    - Print the updated roster showing all pets after pickup.

#    - Remove that pet from the bus.  
#    - Print a message saying they‚Äôve headed home.
